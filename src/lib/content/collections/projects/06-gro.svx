The project aims to further develop a school campus by rethinking the entire site as a succession of heterogeneous and climatic outdoor spaces. The proposed school extension takes advantage of the site's topography to provide ground-level access to both levels. The toit-terrasse is used as a schoolyard and acts as a belvedere overlooking the Rh么ne valley.
